Map---
it is an interface having classes.
map contains values on basis of key and value pair
each value & key called entry
key+value is pair/entry
map is a collection of entries
each key & each value is an object
duplicate keys are not allowed, map contains unique keys, duplicate values allowed

Hashmap----
it is a class used when one needs to perform more search operations
duplicate keys are not allowed
not guarantee order

HashMap and LinkedHashMap allow null keys and values, but TreeMap doesn't allow any null key or value.


HashMap is the implementation of Map,
but it doesn't maintain any order.
LinkedHashMap is the implementation of Map.
It inherits HashMap class. It maintains insertion order.
TreeMap is the implementation of Map and SortedMap.
It maintains ascending order.
